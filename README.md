Physical education in its unique open and dynamic structure plays a huge role in the overall educational process of children to adolescent to adult developmental maturity and lifelong physical activity knowledge skills.

Children in today’s society are entering a world of passive living patterns, emotional turmoil, poor nutrition and general lack of physical activity (Haslam, 1986).  Evidence shows that child obesity and overweight issues are directly connected to widespread physical inactivity and poor nutrition (Graham, Holt/Hale & Parker, 2004).  The health-related conditions limit the child’s quality of life, decrease the life span of the individual, and vastly raise medical expenses. With obese individuals reporting over 42 percent more on health care treatments compared to normal weight populations, which has resulted in a total of $147 billion more in health care costs (Shimon, 2011).  Specifically reported by Pate, O’Neill, and Mclver (2011), in women that lack in physical activity show an increased risk of musculoskeletal problems and men who participated in higher doses of physical activity had the opposite effect and obtained various benefits from moderate to vigorous levels of physical participation.  Physical activity defined by Shimon (2011), “as the bodily movements that help increase energy expenditure and health related fitness levels” (p. 36) that ranges from low to high intensity categories involving individual participation, dual, and team oriented sports or games.  Not to be confused with physical education, the process of learning and using physical activity for development of the person, mind, and body that can instill a physically active lifestyle throughout their lifetime (Graham et al., 2004).  
Aaron Dungca Needham thinks there is emotional turmoil in the terms of adolescent transitions from middle to high school pose challenging times within their immediate family, peer, and scholastic relationships as stated by Harju, Luukkonen, Hakko, Räsänen, and Riala, (2011).  
	Young people as of the last 15 years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of the internet resulting in changes of social interaction and entertainment (Smahel, Blinka, & Brown, 2012).
